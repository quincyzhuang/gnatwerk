title: Layer 2 is scary (ARP and more)
published: true
---

I started my career at Layer 7 in application support. As the years went by, I started making my way down the OSI stack. Today, I feel like I'm finally getting grips on IP/routing concepts at Layer 3, but Layer 2 is another beast. I'd like to talk about OSI Layer 2 - the Data Link Layer.

This stuff used to confuse the shit out of me. If a device has an IP address, I should be able to reach it, right? WRONG.

## MAC Addresses? Sounds vaguely familiar...

Ok, so I play a LOT of Nintendo Switch (yea, I should be studying, I know). You ever seen this fancy-looking MAC address before when getting your Switch hooked up to wifi?

![Switch MAC Address]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/06_20_21_pic1.png "SwitchMac")

This address is the unique identifier for the Switch. My home router will learn this MAC address over the interface/port that the Switch is able to connect to it over, thus establishing Layer 2 connectivity. My router knows that it can now reach the Switch over that same port.

The router then assigns the Switch an IP address via DHCP, so now we have a mapping between Layer 3 information (the Switch's IP address) and Layer 2 information (the Switch's MAC address).

You can also see this happening pretty easily if you can access your router's webpage. I don't have my Switch on hand right since I'm staying with my parents for the week, but I do have my laptop.

## ARP

ARP is the Address Resolution Protocol. Without it, IP routing would just die. For each IP address, there must be a corresponding MAC address underneath. ARP is the bridge between Layer 2 and Layer 3.

## More deets

For ARP to work, all participating must have some kind of adjacency (whether they're on the same LAN by means of a physical cable or a protocol such as VXLAN). 

Let's say PC #1 wants to send some data to PC #2. The former device has IP address 192.168.0.2 and the latter is assigned 192.168.0.3.

![PC#1 and PC#2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/06_20_21_pic4.png "PC to PC")

PC #1 knows that it has to send the data to IP address 192.168.0.2, so it has the Layer 3 information it needs. However, where is it going to get the Layer 2 information so the data frame knows where to go? Enter ARP.

ARP enables a device to retrieve another device's Layer 2 and Layer 3 information by sending an ARP request message to the broadcast MAC address of `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`. This has kind of a megaphone effect - all devices on the same LAN get the message and reply back with their MAC addresses and IP addresses.

Back to our example: PC #1 sends an ARP request.

![PC#1 sending ARP request]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/06_20_21_pic5.png "ARP request")

PC #2 kindly replies with its IP address and MAC address.

![PC #2 sending ARP reply]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/06_20_21_pic6.png "ARP reply")

PC #1 saves PC #2's information into what is known as its ARP cache. Now, it knows that PC #2 `192.168.0.3` can be reached by sending packets to MAC address `d7:b0:a2:14:d7:a9`.

## Caveats

What I described above is a very basic example of how ARP works and how devices are able to discover information about their neighbors. There are caveats, though, which I hope I'll be able to explore in future blog posts. These are:

* Broadcast storms: If you have a large network, ARP requests to `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` can quickly get out of hand.
* ARP looping: In an LAN where devices are interconnected to each other over different ports and cables, ARP can lead to instability and inconsistencies in reachability information. [Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol) was designed to mitigate this problem.

## Next Up

I will have an IS-IS lab coming up at some point. Look forward to that!
