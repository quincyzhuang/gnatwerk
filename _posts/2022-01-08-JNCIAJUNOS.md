title: JNCIA-Junos Certification

Hey, it's been a while. I recently had the idea to get an official network certification under my belt. If my company was going to cover the exam fee, why not? It made a lot of sense, and with the holidays coming around, I felt like I had plenty of time to knock out a certification.

## Juniper Certifications

Juniper provides several different certification [tracks](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification.html) (depending on what your goals are). I decided to go with the Service Provider Routing and Switching track, the first step of which is JNCIA-Junos.

## Preparing 

The full curriculum is listed [here](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/training/certification/tracks/junos/jncia-junos.html), and Juniper provides different ways to get acquainted with the material, including instructor-led lectures. For me, I wanted to spend the least amount of money, so I subscribed [here](https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=EDU-JUN-WBT-JOL-JNCIA-JUNOS) and gained access to a self-paced video lecture series for no cost.

Basically, I watched one or two chapters a day (total of 19 chapters) over the holiday break, took notes, and reasoned through the labs at the end of each chapter. The process took about a month and felt well-paced. The really nice thing about learning this way is that you get to take a practice test at the end of the video series. If you score high enough (>70%), you get a voucher that decreases the cost of the exam registration. How cool is that? I think the original cost without the discount is 200 USD.

One thing to keep in mind is that the "subscription" only lasts for a limited time, so you need to make sure you can start the course and commit to it. The time window was something like 180 days, so you really should have plenty of time.

## The Exam

I registered for the exam through PearsonVue, making sure to use the discount code. During the pandemic, they've been doing webcam-monitored exams, which is nice if you're worried about going to a physical testing site. In addition to re-reading my notes and going over the video lectures, I took advantage of a couple apps and flashcard websites to brush up on the material:

* [Flashcards I found on Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/25247331/jncia-flash-cards/)
* [Practice test on the Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anandsoft.jncia&hl=en_US&gl=US)

## Thoughts

I'd already had been working as a network engineer for 7 months when I decided to pursue this certification, so I knew some of the material already. The JNCIA really only served to introduce some concepts and JunOS features I didn't pick up at work, such as JunOS architecture. Keep that in mind if you're a newbie to the field. You might take longer than me to complete the course material.

You also are grilled on some pretty (in my opinion) arcane stuff, like what exactly happens if you type `exit` from within a configuration mode hierarchy, or what `ctrl+e` does within the JunOS cli. Stuff like this is easily looked up in Juniper's excellent TechLibrary, so there definitely is a lot of fluff knowledge. IMO, just make sure you get down the routing and architecture basics.

All in all, I'm pretty happy I got the JNCIA. I felt like it was a good use of time that would have otherwise been spent napping or eating Christmas fruitcake. Thanks for reading!
