Welcome! This should be the first post of many. I recently was given the opportunity to become a Network Engineer. My background is completely different (Healthcare IT, Biomedical Engineering). I intend to document what I learn on the job and put together some informative posts. 

A bit more about myself and my current skillset:
* Intermediate python
* "Enough to get around" knowledge of [BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol)
* Rudimentary experience in JunOS navigation/configuration (SRX series, MX series)

That's it for today. Today also marks my first day of onboarding onto the job and the beginning of my transition off my previous job (Escalation Engineer).
